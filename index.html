            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Zhanna Zhanashova</strong>, a passionate Bachelor student of
                Computer Science at SDU. With a deep interest in UX/UI design and innovative
                technology solutions, I aim to blend creativity with functionality in every project I undertake.
                I believe in the power of design to not only enhance user experience but also to solve
                real-world problems.</p>

            <h2>Summary of Projects</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="about-me-content">
            <p>Throughout the course, my perspective on UX/UI design has evolved significantly.
                Initially, I saw it as a field focused mainly on creating visually appealing interfaces.
                However, after working on three distinct projects, I've come to realize that UX/UI is about
                much more than aesthetics—it's about user-centric problem-solving, research, and
                continuous iteration.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 1: Sleep-Tracking App Design</h3>
                <p>In this project, I focused on understanding user behavior and mental models to improve
                    sleep patterns through app features. The experience emphasized the importance of
                    psychological aspects and the user journey in crafting a personalized, effective experience.
                    I learned that UX is not just about the interface but about creating a product that
                    serves the user’s deeper needs and goals.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 2: Improving the Shopping Experience</h3>
                <p>This project shifted my focus to real-world problem solving. The redesign of the SDU Market,
                    with the introduction of the postomat system, focused on reducing friction in the
                    shopping process and prioritizing convenience. Through data collection, user feedback,
                    and iterative testing, I realized how crucial it is to integrate user pain points and
                    behaviors into the design, while balancing technical feasibility with user satisfaction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 3: SDU Scout Robot</h3>
                <p>In this project, I expanded my perspective to include interaction design and
                    user research. The SDU Scout Robot aimed to help students find study rooms,
                    highlighting the importance of integrating designs into users' daily routines.
                    This project taught me that UX/UI design must also account for the broader ecosystem
                    in which the product exists and ensure the design is adaptable to various use cases.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>What is UX/UI now?</h3>
            <p>Overall, my understanding of UX/UI has grown into a process of crafting experiences
                that are intuitive, efficient, and deeply aligned with user needs. It’s not just about
                making things look nice—it’s about creating empathy for users, solving real problems, and
                ensuring that every design decision enhances the user experience. UX/UI design is a balance
                of creativity, functionality, and empathy, ensuring the final product is not only usable
                but also meaningful.</p>
