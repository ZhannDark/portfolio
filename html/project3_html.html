                <p>
                    The goal is to improve a sleep-tracking app tailored for students,
                    integrating behavioral change techniques and data from wearable devices. The app aims to
                    address issues like irregular sleep patterns, stress, and phone distractions, helping
                    students build healthier sleep habits.

        <h3 class="underline">My Role</h3>
        <p>
            In the <b>Sleep Tracking App</b> project, my role was focused on background research and data collection.
            I analyzed the sleep habits of university students and conducted interviews to understand their
            challenges and preferences. I collected key insights, such as irregular sleep patterns, stress, and the
            impact of late-night phone usage, which were critical in shaping the direction of the project.
            These findings informed the improvements made to the existing Tide app, ensuring it addressed
            real user needs.
            Specifically, I designed and conducted interviews, compiled data on user behaviors, and identified
            essential features like AI-driven insights, reminders, and distraction-blocking tools.
            My work helped pinpoint the importance of integrating smartwatches and providing actionable
            feedback to users.

        <h3 class="underline">Background</h3>
        <p>Many university students struggle with poor sleep habits due to stress, busy schedules,
            and phone distractions. The goal of the project is to create a smartwatch-compatible app
            that provides personalized tips, reminders, and insights to help students build better
            sleep routines.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sleep Habits: </b> Irregular schedules, stress, and late-night phone
                use are common issues.</li>
            <li><b>Awareness: </b> Few students use existing apps like Sleep Cycle,Meditopia
                due to lack of motivation.</li>
            <li><b>User Needs: </b> Students prefer features like reminders, insights,
                and rewards for healthy sleep.</li>
            <li><b>Concerns: </b> Privacy and data accuracy are critical.</li>

                Students struggle with inconsistent bedtimes due to homework and exams,
                causing fatigue and poor concentration.</li>
            <li><b>Stress and Mental Health: </b>
                Stress and anxiety about studies and personal life disrupt sleep, making
                it hard to relax and fall asleep.</li>
            <li><b>Technology Distractions: </b>
                Using phones before bed leads to staying awake longer or feeling anxious,
                affecting sleep quality.</li>

        <h2>Competitive Testing</h2>
        <p>
            We chose competitive testing for our app to evaluate its features against similar sleep tracking
            apps like Sleep Cycle and Meditopia. This approach allowed us to understand the strengths and
            weaknesses of competing applications and identify areas where our app could offer a better experience,
            particularly for students. By analyzing their functionality, we were able to pinpoint missing features
            that were important to our target audience, such as social media blocking, AI-driven sleep analytics,
            and wearable integration.
            Additionally, we gathered feedback from student users to further refine our design and features.
            Their insights helped us prioritize the inclusion of real-time engagement elements, such as push
            notifications for sleep reminders, and streamlined the user interface for a more intuitive experience.
            This testing process was key to ensuring our app addressed student-specific needs and provided
            meaningful improvements to their sleep habits.

        <h3 class="underline">What I Learned</h3>
        <p>
            From this project, I learned the importance of understanding user behaviors and aligning app
            features with their needs. I also realized the value of tackling broader challenges like stress
            management and technology distractions to create meaningful behavior changes. This experience
            influenced my approach to future projects by emphasizing the role of thorough user research and the
            integration of feedback to ensure solutions are user-centered and effective. It also reinforced
            the need to balance innovation with practicality, making technology both engaging and functional.
