                <p>
                    The SDU market is popular among students for its variety of snacks and beverages,
                    but its inefficiencies during peak hours—such as long queues, overcrowding, and slow
                    checkouts—lead to customer frustration. This project aimed to redesign the shopping experience,
                    focusing on minimizing wait times and improving satisfaction.

        <h3 class="underline">My role</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: lighter">For the project <b>"Improving the Shopping Experience at SDU Market,"
        </b> I focused on creating sketches,
            prototypes, and wireframes. These served as the foundation for visualizing the redesigned shopping
            experience. My role also involved ensuring that the designs were user-friendly, visually appealing,
            and addressed the pain points identified during the research phase, such as overcrowding and
            long queues.</h4>
        <h3>Specific Contributions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sketches: </b> I drafted initial ideas, visually representing potential solutions to improve
                the market's layout and processes.</li>
            <li><b>Wireframes: </b> I developed detailed wireframes to outline the structure of the
                redesign, ensuring clarity and functionality.</li>
            <li><b>Prototypes: </b> I created interactive prototypes, allowing team members and stakeholders
                to test and experience the proposed changes before implementation.</li>

            <b>Moderated RITE Testing Plan for Postomat System at SDU Market</b>
        </p>
        <div class="data_analysis">
            <p>The Postomat system at SDU Market aims to reduce queues by allowing students to order online,
                pay in advance, and pick up their purchases using a QR code. The testing will evaluate the usability
                of the online ordering system and the postomat pickup process, identifying any issues to improve
                user experience and minimize queues. The participants will include 5-7 members from the SDU
                community, both regular users and those unfamiliar with postomats. The prototypes include an
                online ordering platform (app/website) and the postomat interface for QR code scanning and order
                retrieval. Participants will complete the online ordering and pickup process, with metrics for
                task completion, time spent, errors, and feedback. The RITE methodology will be used, with initial
                tests identifying issues and successive rounds of testing to improve the prototypes. The expected
                results are reduced wait times, an intuitive system, and positive user feedback on convenience.
                Data will be collected through quantitative measures of time and errors, and qualitative feedback
                on the overall user experience.</p>

        <h3 class="underline">What I learn?</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: lighter">From this project, I learned the importance of user-centered design
            and incorporating feedback from real users into the design process. I also gained a deeper
            understanding of aligning design elements with project goals to solve specific problems effectively.</p>
        <p>This experience taught me to approach future projects with an iterative mindset—starting
            with low-fidelity designs and refining them based on feedback. It also emphasized the importance
            of usability testing and collaboration to ensure a design not only looks good but also works well.
            These insights have influenced how I plan and execute tasks in subsequent projects, ensuring a more
            structured and user-focused workflow.</p>
