                    To understand the real challenges students face on campus, we conducted interviews with students
                    from various backgrounds. These conversations helped us uncover their main pain point: the
                    difficulty in finding free study rooms. By engaging directly with potential users, we gained
                    valuable insights into their daily experiences and needs.

        <h3 class="underline">My role</h3>
        <p>For the SDU Scout Robot project, I was involved in creating sketches and a storyboard to visualize how the
            robot would interact with students. These visuals helped us communicate our design ideas clearly to the
            team and make decisions about the user experience. Each team member also contributed by conducting
            interviews with students and analyzing the collected data to understand their needs better.</p>

            <p>
                Using the information collected from the interviews, we organized the data into an affinity diagram
                to identify recurring themes and group similar issues. This helped us create scenarios representing
                typical user experiences, like students struggling to find study rooms during exams.

                We also created a sketch of the robot to visualize its design and appearance. The sketch focuses on
                how the robot will look, giving a clear representation of its physical form and key features.

                A group of students is looking for a study room during the afternoon, but they aren't sure which
                rooms are free.

                We tested the prototype with three students, focusing on finding available study rooms. Their feedback
                helped us improve the design, ensuring it was simple and effective. This experience influenced my
                approach to the next project by helping me focus more on user experience from the start. I understood
                that user feedback and testing are essential for developing a system that meets real needs. In our
                future work, I plan to incorporate these lessons by focusing more on creating clear visual aids and
                ensuring that every feature addresses actual user problems, based on thorough research and testing.

        <h3 class="underline">What I learn?</h3>
        <p>Through this project, I learned how to combine design with functionality to create a user-friendly
            solution. I also realized how important it is to ensure that the design not only looks good but
            is practical for real-life use. Working on the storyboard taught me how to visualize a user’s journey,
            which helped us refine the robot's interactions and responses.</p>
